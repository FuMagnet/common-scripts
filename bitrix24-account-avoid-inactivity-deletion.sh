# Use this script to avoid deletion of the account due to inactivity.
# It creates a directory with a random name on Bitrix24.Drive and deletes it immediately.
#
# VERSION: 01.01.00
#
# BACKGROUND:
# If an instance of Bitrix24 on a free plan (either converted to a free plan or originally on a free plan) is completely inactive over the course of 30 days, 
# it is 'archived', and it can be retrieved only by an administrator account (yourself or a user in the instance with administrator rights). 
# To retrieve the account, an administrator simply needs to log in. If no administrator logs in for another 15 days after the instance has been 'archived', 
# the Bitrix24 instance will be deleted. Please note â€“ this does not affect Bitrix24 paid plans subscribers.
#
# REQUIREMENTS:
# curl / base64 / uuidgen
#
# RUN:
# chmod +x ./bitrix24-account-avoid-inactivity-deletion.sh
# ./bitrix24-account-avoid-inactivity-deletion.sh
